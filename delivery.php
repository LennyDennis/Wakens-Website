                                Hanawell’s “On-Premises and Best-of-Breed” Training Delivery
                                <ul>
                                    <li>Hanawell’s “On-premises and best-of-breed” training delivery products, provides
                                        an application simulation tool. </li>
                                    <li>By effectively utilizing the application simulation tool, Hanawell’s training
                                        delivery becomes more efficient, robust, repeatable, cost- effective and
                                        consistent. .</li>
                                    <li>Application simulations allow user interaction within pre-defined procedures
                                        without having to connect to a training environment. </li>
                                    <li>Users can learn how to perform transactions in the system by first viewing a
                                        demonstration and then by performing the same transaction themselves.</li>
                                    <li>Enabling the target audience of the change to perform in the future state.</li>
                                    <li>Planning to sustain new ways of working and for continuous improvement in the
                                        desired future state.</li>
                                    <li>The benefits of using application simulations are:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Increased mobility of the training delivery method as the training
                                                location does not need to have connections to the training server.</li>
                                            <li>Enablement of users to practice and learn at their own pace, on their
                                                own device within the application simulations and outside of planned
                                                training course times.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </li>
                                    <li>Assurance of consistent quality and contents regardless of when or where the
                                        training is conducted or accessed</li>
                                </ul>
