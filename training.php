              Hanawell implementation team develops training strategies tailor made and unique to each client’s implementation.
            </p>
            
            <p class="consultation-desc mb-2">
              At a minimum, the training strategy includes:
              <ul>
                <li>Acknowledgement of the specific learning needs of each client’s stakeholder groups.</li>
                <li>Product-driven training using user-specific stories and customised client process scenarios for relatability and familiarity.</li>
                <li>Training for core business capabilities, as well as technical training in tools, standards, technology and data.</li>
                <li>Diverse delivery methods based on audience and content needs to build knowledge over time, including accessible formats.</li>
                <li>Learner completion statistics and assessment metrics to drive accountability and gauge learning retention.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>







            <p class="consultation-desc mb-2">
              The key objective of training is to educate and equip a user with the skills and knowledge to perform their work using the new system and business processes.</br>
              Hanawell utilises expanding methods to include a mix of different learning and training approaches, including eLearning, self-serve and train-the-trainer methodologies.
              <ul>
                <li>Pre-Training Preparation</li>
                <li>
                  Generating interest and awareness of training content via engaging pre-training communications (such as promotional videos).
                </li>
                <li>
                  The target training audience, especially those requiring direct interactions with the system, should feel the ‘need’ for training.
                </li>
                <li>Training Delivery Mechanisms</li>
                <li>
                  Matching training delivery mechanisms to the training needs of different target groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Matching training delivery mechanisms to the training needs of different target groups.
                </li>
                <li>
                Training audiences in different geographical locations by customizing training delivery mechanisms to suit the audience.
                </li>
                <li>Design of Training Course	</li>
                <li>Acknowledging the learning needs of users and incorporating them into the design and delivery of the course, e.g., focusing on practical business application, ensuring clarity of learning outcomes.</li>
                <li>‘Teach them to fish’ – training courses that encourage users to seek information independently at the point of need. </li>
                <li>Delivery of Training Course	</li>
                <li>Hanawell trainers are well-equipped with business skills and system knowledge to impart knowledge and to facilitate instruction. This includes trainers and train-the-trainers.</li>
                <li>Application simulations baked into the training environment allow hands-on practice to promote a positive learning experience for users. </li>
                <li>Availability of Performance Support Tools	</li>
                <li>Performance support tools (application simulations, reference guides) are made available online at point of need. This reduces reliance on personal assistance and provides consistent guidance regardless of personnel turnover.</li>
              </ul>

              Training development is a responsibility of the SAP project. <br>
              The Hanawell team creates training through the design, development and delivery stages of the project. <br>
              Hanawell is always exploring new generation training tools that can be used to deliver short and effective training modules with application (system) simulations.<br>
              Training environment and training spaces are created by replicating the User Acceptance Test (UAT) environment, allowing users to practice using the system at their own pace and outside of planned training sessions. <br>

              Hanawell’s “On-Premises and Best-of-Breed” Training Delivery
              <ul>
                <li>Hanawell’s “On-premises and best-of-breed” training delivery products, provides an application simulation tool. </li>
                <li>By effectively utilizing the application simulation tool, Hanawell’s training delivery becomes more efficient, robust, repeatable, cost- effective and consistent. .</li>
                <li>Application simulations allow user interaction within pre-defined procedures without having to connect to a training environment. </li>
                <li>Users can learn how to perform transactions in the system by first viewing a demonstration and then by performing the same transaction themselves.</li>
                <li>Enabling the target audience of the change to perform in the future state.</li>
                <li>Planning to sustain new ways of working and for continuous improvement in the desired future state.</li>
                <li>The benefits of using application simulations are:
                  <ul>
                    <li>Increased mobility of the training delivery method as the training location does not need to have connections to the training server.</li>
                    <li>Enablement of users to practice and learn at their own pace, on their own device within the application simulations and outside of planned training course times.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Assurance of consistent quality and contents regardless of when or where the training is conducted or accessed
